I am currently a  <a href="https://sociology.northwestern.edu/people/graduate-students/profiles/taylor-domingos.html">PhD student at Northwestern University</a> in the Department of Sociology. I received my bachelor's degree in Sociology, Criminology, and Women and Gender Studies from the University of Toronto. I also received my masters in Sociology from University of Toronto 🇨🇦. My current research interests are plentiful but include gender and crime, policing, incarceration, and the criminal legal system. 

My research is driven by a commitment to advancing research on gender, crime, neighborhood inequality, incarceration:

- Illicit Markets and Neighborhood Changes: My current ongoing project includes collaborating on a project examining illicit markets and neighborhood changes in Chicago and Toronto over the past 30 years. 

- Harm Reduction and Policing in Toronto: I am also analyzing 29 years of arrest data (from 1992 to 2020) to examine the relationship between harm reduction service provision and police enforcement of drug sales and possession in the city of Toronto. This research focuses on the relationship between harm reduction service provision and police enforcement of drug sales and possession, aiming to understand how public health approaches intersect with law enforcement practices.

- Gender and Police Violence: My master's thesis, forthcoming in Socius, explores racial differences and gender similarities in fatal and nonfatal police use of force incidents using data from California’s Open Justice portal (2016-2021). This study reveals that femininity does not provide protection in escalated policing situations within racial groups.
